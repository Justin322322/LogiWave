LogiWave
LogiWave is a simulation tool for modeling delivery event propagation across logistics hubs over time. Using a custom spatial-temporal data structure (ChronoMap) and a wave-based algorithm (EventWave Propagation), this project simulates how shipment updates ripple through a delivery network.

Features
Custom ChronoMap data structure for efficient event management by time and location.
Simulates delivery status updates propagating to nearby logistics hubs with configurable delay and range.
Efficient time-based cleanup of outdated events.
Simple and extensible codebase for integrating real-world logistics data or visualizations.
Use Case
This simulation models how logistics events such as package arrivals, transfers, or alerts propagate in a network of delivery hubs. For example, when a package arrives at Hub A, it triggers updates to nearby hubs (e.g., B, C, D) after a certain delay, mimicking real-world communication or transfer patterns.

Configuration
Modify the following parameters in eventwave.py to adjust the simulation:

max_time: Total simulation time (default: 6)
wave_delay: Delay between event propagation steps (default: 1)
radius: Distance to propagate events in each step (default: 1 unit)
Potential Extensions
Integrate with real logistics data to simulate actual shipment movements.
Add visual representation of hubs and event propagation.
Enhance spatial indexing using QuadTree for larger-scale simulations.
Export event logs for further analysis or dashboard integration.
